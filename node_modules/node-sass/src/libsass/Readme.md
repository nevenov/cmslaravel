LibSass is just a library, but if you want to RUN LibSass,
then go to https://github.com/sass/sassc or
https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby or
[find your local implementer](docs/implementations.md).

LibSass requires GCC 4.6+ or Clang/LLVM. If your OS is older, this version may not compile.

On Windows, you need MinGW with GCC 4.6+ or VS 2013 Update 4+. It is also possible to build LibSass with Clang/LLVM on Windows.

[LibSass](https://github.com/sass/libsass "LibSass GitHub Project") is just a library!
If you want to use LibSass to compile Sass, you need an implementer. Some
implementations are only bindings into other programming languages. But most also
ship with a command line interface (CLI) you can use directly. There is also
[SassC](https://github.com/sass/sassc), which is the official lightweight
CLI tool built by the same people as LibSass.

### Excerpt of "sanctioned" implementations:

- https://github.com/sass/node-sass (Node.js)
- https://github.com/sass/perl-libsass (Perl)
- https://github.com/sass/libsass-python (Python)
- https://github.com/wellington/go-libsass (Go)
- https://github.com/sass/sassc-ruby (Ruby)
- https://github.com/sass/libsass-net (C#)
- https://github.com/medialize/sass.js (JS)
- https://github.com/bit3/jsass (Java)

This list does not say anything about the quality of either the listed or not listed [implementations](docs/implementations.md)!  
The authors of the listed projects above are just known to work regularly together with LibSass developers.

About
-----

<<<<<<< HEAD
LibSass is a C/C++ port of the Sass CSS precompiler. The original version was written in Ruby, but this version is meant for efficiency and portability.

This library strives to be light, simple, and easy to build and integrate with a variety of platforms and languages.
=======
LibSass is a C++ port of the original Ruby Sass CSS compiler with a [C API](docs/api-doc.md).
We coded LibSass with portability and efficiency in mind. You can expect LibSass to be a lot
faster than Ruby Sass and on par or faster than the best alternative CSS compilers around.
>>>>>>> dev

Developing
----------

<<<<<<< HEAD
As you may have noticed, the LibSass repo itself has
no executables and no tests. Oh noes! How can you develop???

Well, luckily, [SassC](http://github.com/sass/sassc) is the official binary wrapper for
LibSass and is *always* kept in sync. SassC uses a git submodule
to include LibSass. When developing LibSass, its best to actually
check out SassC and develop in that directory with the SassC spec
and tests there.

We even run Travis tests for SassC!

Tests
-------

Since LibSass is a pure library, tests are run through the [SassSpec](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec) project using the [SassC](http://github.com/sass/sassc) driver.

To run tests against LibSass while developing, you can run `./script/spec`. This will clone SassC and Sass-Spec under the project folder and then run the Sass-Spec test suite. You may want to update the clones to ensure you have the latest version.

Library Usage
-------------

While LibSass is a library primarily written in C++, it provides a simple
C interface which should be used by most implementers. LibSass does not do
much on its own without an implementer. This can be a command line tool, like
[sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc) or a [binding](docs/implementations.md)
to your favorite programing language.

If you want to build or interface with LibSass, we recommend to check out the
documentation pages about [building LibSass](docs/build.md) and
the [C-API documentation](docs/api-doc.md).
=======
As noted above, the LibSass repository does not contain any binaries or other way to execute
LibSass. Therefore, you need an implementer to develop LibSass. Easiest is to start with
the official [SassC](http://github.com/sass/sassc) CLI wrapper. It is *guaranteed* to compile
with the latest code in LibSass master, since it is also used in the CI process. There is no
limitation here, as you may use any other LibSass implementer to test your LibSass branch!

Testing
-------

Since LibSass is a pure library, tests are run through the [Sass-Spec](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec)
project using the [SassC](http://github.com/sass/sassc) CLI wrapper. To run the tests against LibSass while
developing, you can run `./script/spec`. This will clone SassC and Sass-Spec under the project folder and
then run the Sass-Spec test suite. You may want to update the clones to ensure you have the latest version.
Note that the scripts in the `./script` folder are mainly intended for our CI needs.

Building
--------

To build LibSass you need GCC 4.6+ or Clang/LLVM. If your OS is older, you may need to upgrade
them first (or install clang as an alternative). On Windows, you need MinGW with GCC 4.6+ or VS 2013
Update 4+. It is also possible to build LibSass with Clang/LLVM on Windows with various build chains
and/or command line interpreters.

See the [build docs for further instructions](docs/build.md)!

Compatibility
-------------

Current LibSass 3.4 should be compatible with Sass 3.4. Please refer to the [sass compatibility
page](http://sass-compatibility.github.io/) for a more detailed comparison. But note that there
are still a few incomplete edges which we are aware of. Otherwise LibSass has reached a good level
of stability, thanks to our ever growing [Sass-Spec test suite](https://github.com/sass/sass-spec).

About Sass
----------

<<<<<<< HEAD
Sass is a CSS pre-processor language to add on exciting, new,
awesome features to CSS. Sass was the first language of its kind
and by far the most mature and up to date codebase.

Sass was originally concieved of by the co-creator of this library,
Hampton Catlin ([@hcatlin]). Most of the language has been the result of years
of work by Natalie Weizenbaum ([@nex3]) and Chris Eppstein ([@chriseppstein]).

For more information about Sass itself, please visit http://sass-lang.com

Initial development of libsass by Aaron Leung and Hampton Catlin was supported by [Moovweb](http://www.moovweb.com).
